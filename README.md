# personal_pollution_exposure_API
This is work a part of the project submitted for fulfilment of the UIC CS 586: Data and Web Semantics Class for Fall 2018.
This project works resembles an API to communicate raw sensor data to ontology-based instances.

Project Abstract:
Pollution is the cause of critical health conditions as studies in epidemiology have shown. Efforts to monitor pollution are being put to reduce the severe effect of pollution on the health of the population.  Efforts are being exerted into creating personal pollution monitoring tools. Personal pollution monitoring tools produce data at a high volume, therefore, there is an urgent need to systematically and formally manage this data. In this project, I introduce Personal Pollution Exposure Ontology and a Java tool to interact with this ontology. The ontology captures the sensor readings as well as focuses on capturing the context of the exposure. The API transforms raw sensor readings from the database to ontology individuals.
